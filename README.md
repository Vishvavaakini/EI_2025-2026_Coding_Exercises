## Why Design Patterns Matter

Design patterns are tried-and-tested solutions to common problems in software design. Instead of reinventing the wheel, developers can rely on these reusable templates to build cleaner and more maintainable systems.

## Benefits of following design patterns:

- Design patterns act like ready-made solutions; no need to reinvent the wheel every time.  
- They help keep the codebase consistent so anyone on the team can quickly understand it.  
- Maintenance becomes easier because the structure is already clear and predictable.  
- As the project grows, patterns make it simpler to scale and extend without breaking things.  
- These are approaches that have already been tested in real projects, so common mistakes are avoided.  
- Using the name of a pattern (like “Singleton” or “Observer”) makes it faster to communicate ideas within the team.
