# Design Patterns in Java  

##  Overview  
This repository showcases a collection of **Design Patterns implemented in Java**.  
Patterns are organized into three main categories:  
- **Creational Patterns**  
- **Structural Patterns**  
- **Behavioral Patterns**  

Each pattern includes:  
- A clear **description** of the pattern  
- A **real-world use case** explaining when and why to use it  
- A **Java implementation** demonstrating the pattern in action  
- **Example output** to see how it behaves at runtime
